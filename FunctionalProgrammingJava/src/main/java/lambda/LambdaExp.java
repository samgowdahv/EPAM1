package lambda;

public class LambdaExp {
    //to implement SAM (single abstract method ) , hence called anonymous method

    /* A method needs 4 things name ,return  type , input parameters and body
     int doStuff(int a){
     // do stuff
     // return c;
     }

     for a Single abstract method we don't need name , as we will be referring to only one method , return type can always be inferred from body
     whether we are returning anything and what is its type
     so the above method can also be written as
     (int a)-{ dostuff return c;}

     this is nothing but lambda expression , it can only be employed for SAM (single abstract method )
     we will also go with difference between SAM and anonymous class .
